# CebuanoLLPSIConcept

Note: This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


Heavily based on works like Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, I created this because I noticed
that there aren't too much material for learning Cebuano, that takes the Comprehensible Input approach.

This website is STILL VERY much a work in progress but, on it, you can find a small amount of articles, written in simple Cebuano. 

In the future, I aim to add some interactive quizzes, more original readings, including toggles for diacritics to help with pronunciations. Other goals that I intend to accomplish include a badlit/kudlit toggle and audio recordings as well.

If you would like to contribute to the project... feel free! You can reach out to me at:

### Last Update (3/11/25):
- To reduce the amount of content one has to read on a single page, rather than having
all the text from that page display at once, I decided to hide some of the content, as
id'd subpages that are initially hidden except for the first one. I then added a simple JavaScript script, that can dynamically alter and display which content is displayed, having
page numbers at that button that listen to when the user clicks on them.
- Also fixed some basic display things, mainly making things more alligned.
